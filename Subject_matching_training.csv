Capstone Project A,"The capstone project requires the student to plan and execute a substantial research-based project, using their technical and communication skills to design, evaluate, implement, analyse and theorise about developments that contribute to professional practice thus demonstrating the achievement of AQF Level 9. Students are required to carry out a defined piece of independent research in a setting and in a manner that fosters the development of engineering research skills. These skills include the capacity to define a research question, showing how it relates to existing knowledge, identifying the tools needed to investigate the question, carrying out the research in a systematic way, analysing the results obtained and presenting the outcomes in a report that is clear, coherent and logically structured. Capstone project is undertaken across two semesters of enrolment, in two successive Units of Study of 6 credits points each. Capstone Project A covers first steps of thesis research starting with development of research proposal. Project B covers the second of stage writing up and presenting the research results. Students are asked to write a thesis based on a research project, which is very often related to some aspect of a staff member's research interests. Some projects will be experimental in nature, others may involve computer-based simulation, feasibility studies or the design, construction and testing of equipment. Direction of thesis work may be determined by the supervisor, however the student is expected to make a significant contribution to the direction of the project, and the student is responsible for the execution of the practical work and the general layout and content of the thesis itself. The final thesis must be the student's individual work, although research is sometimes conducted in the framework of a group project shared with others. Students undertaking research on this basis will need to take care in ensuring the individual quality of their own research work and the final thesis submission. The thesis will be judged on the extent and quality of the student's original work and particularly how critical, perceptive and constructive he or she has been in assessing his/her work and that of others. Students will also be required to present the results of their findings to their peers and supervisors as part of a seminar program. A thesis at this level will represent a contribution to professional practice or research, however the timeframe available for the thesis also needs to be considered when developing project scopes. Indeed, a key aim of the thesis is to specify a research topic that arouses sufficient intellectual curiosity, and presents an appropriate range and diversity of technical and conceptual challenges, while remaining manageable and allowing achievable outcomes within the time and resources available. It is important that the topic be of sufficient scope and complexity to allow a student to learn their craft and demonstrate their research skills. Equally imperative is that the task not be so demanding as to elude completion. Finally the ability to plan such a project to achieve results within constraints and the identification of promising areas and approaches for future research is a key assessment criterion.",Biomedical

Thesis A,"The ability to plan, systematically conduct and report on a major project, involving both research and design, is an important skill for professional engineers. The final year thesis units (Thesis A and Thesis B) aim to provide students with the opportunity to carry out a defined piece of independent research and design that fosters the development of engineering skills. These skills include: the capacity to define a problem; carry out systematic research in exploring how it relates to existing knowledge; identifying the tools needed to address the problem; designing a solution, product or prototype; analysing the results obtained; and presenting the outcomes in a report that is clear, coherent and logically structured. The thesis is undertaken across two CONSECUTIVE semesters of enrollment, if not students will have to enroll in Thesis A again. Taken together, the thesis A covers initial research into the background of the problem being considered (formulated as a literature review), development of a detailed proposal incorporating project objectives, planning, and risk assessment, preliminary design, modelling and/or experimental work, followed by the detailed work in designing a solution, performing experiments, evaluating outcomes, analysing results, and writing up and presenting the outcomes. The final grade is based on the work done in both Honours Thesis A and B, and will be awarded upon successful completion Thesis B. While recognising that some projects can be interdisciplinary in nature, it is the normal expectation that the students would do the project in their chosen area of specialisation. For student who are completing a Major within their BE degree, the thesis topic must be within the area of the Major. The theses to be undertaken by students will very often be related to some aspect of a staff member's research interests.

These skills include: the capacity to define a problem; carry out systematic research in exploring how it relates to existing knowledge; identifying the tools needed to address the problem; designing a solution, product or prototype; analysing the results obtained; and presenting the outcomes in a report that is clear, coherent and logically structured. The thesis is undertaken across two CONSECUTIVE semesters of enrollment, if not students will have to enroll in Thesis A again. Taken together, the thesis A covers initial research into the background of the problem being considered (formulated as a literature review), development of a detailed proposal incorporating project objectives, planning, and risk assessment, preliminary design, modelling and/or experimental work, followed by the detailed work in designing a solution, performing experiments, evaluating outcomes, analysing results, and writing up and presenting the outcomes. The final grade is based on the work done in both Honours Thesis A and B, and will be awarded upon successful completion Thesis B. While recognising that some projects can be interdisciplinary in nature, it is the normal expectation that the students would do the project in their chosen area of specialisation. For student who are completing a Major within their BE degree, the thesis topic must be within the area of the Major. The theses to be undertaken by students will very often be related to some aspect of a staff member's research interests. Some projects will be experimental in nature, others may involve computer-based simulation and analysis, feasibility studies or the design, construction and testing of equipment. All however will require students to undertake research and design relevant to the topic of their thesis. The direction of thesis work may be determined by the supervisor or be of an original nature, but in either case the student is responsible for the execution of the practical work and the general layout and content of the thesis itself. The thesis must be the student's individual work although it may be conducted as a component of a wider group project. Students undertaking research on this basis will need to take care in ensuring the quality of their own research and design work and their individual final thesis submission. The thesis will be judged on the extent and quality of the student's original work and particularly how critical, perceptive and constructive he or she has been in assessing his/her work and that of others. Students will also be required to present the results of their thesis to their peers and supervisors as part of a seminar program. Whilst thesis topics will be constrained by the available time and resources, the aim is to contribute to the creation of new engineering knowledge, techniques and/or solutions. Students should explore topics that arouse intellectual curiosity and represent an appropriate range and diversity of technical and conceptual research and design challenges.",Biomedical

Capstone Project A,"The capstone project requires the student to plan and execute a substantial research-based project, using their technical and communication skills to design, evaluate, implement, analyse and theorise about developments that contribute to professional practice thus demonstrating the achievement of AQF Level 9. Students are required to carry out a defined piece of independent research in a setting and in a manner that fosters the development of engineering research skills. These skills include the capacity to define a research question, showing how it relates to existing knowledge, identifying the tools needed to investigate the question, carrying out the research in a systematic way, analysing the results obtained and presenting the outcomes in a report that is clear, coherent and logically structured. Capstone project is undertaken across two semesters of enrolment, in two successive Units of Study of 6 credits points each. Capstone Project A covers first steps of thesis research starting with development of research proposal. Project B covers the second of stage writing up and presenting the research results. Students are asked to write a thesis based on a research project, which is very often related to some aspect of a staff member's research interests.

A thesis at this level will represent a contribution to professional practice or research, however the timeframe available for the thesis also needs to be considered when developing project scopes. Indeed, a key aim of the thesis is to specify a research topic that arouses sufficient intellectual curiosity, and presents an appropriate range and diversity of technical and conceptual challenges, while remaining manageable and allowing achievable outcomes within the time and resources available. It is important that the topic be of sufficient scope and complexity to allow a student to learn their craft and demonstrate their research skills. Equally imperative is that the task not be so demanding as to elude completion. Finally the ability to plan such a project to achieve results within constraints and the identification of promising areas and approaches for future research is a key assessment criterion.",Biomedical

Spreadsheets and databases are two of the most commonly used and powerful computer tools yet they are often poorly utilised and the reasons for using one rather than the other are poorly understood. Many people purchase Microsoft Office which comes bundled with Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access - a spreadsheet and a database application - yet while many people have some familiarity with Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access is rarely utilised. This course aims to explain in straightforward terms the concepts underlying both of these powerful pieces of software so that students can exploit them effectively for both their studies and future careers. It will investigate how to design and implement effective spreadsheet and database applications. Students should also be able to transfer these skills to other, similar spreadsheet and database packages. Students will be expected to have personal copies of Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Access on their own computers.

User Interface Design and Construction,"This course is a project-based course designed to build on the basic skills acquired in COMP3511 â Human Computer Interaction. The course addresses the skills and knowledge required in industry to brainstorm, design, implement, and evaluate an application through the user-centred design process. Because this is an iterative process, students will be required to build their interface at least three times, starting with a low-fidelity prototype and building to high-fidelity and more complete prototypes. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the importance of user-centred design and how it is applied in the industry to design, test and build a functioning application. 
The course is built to reflect up-to-date industry practice and methods. You would have benefitted from also completing COMP2911, which introduces you to object-oriented techniques, UML and design patterns.

(In-)Formal Methods: The Lost Art,"(In-)Formal MethodsÂ are practical structuring and design patterns that encourage programming that is easy to understand and to maintain. They are only a part of the large body of âgood programming practices,â distinguished from that larger set because âfor the methods we considerâ the computer-science community has determined theÂ scienceÂ behind the structures: we know why they are effective.

Unusually, this course does not take the traditional route of teaching that science first, and then turning it into practical programming âtools-of-thought.â Instead, we teach the mental tools first, try them on examples and only then, once their effectiveness has been demonstrated, will we look behind the scenes to see where they come from.

Initially the material will deal with conventional programs, those that must âgive the right output.â (This is known asÂ functionalÂ correctness, and a sorting program is a simple example.) Later in the course we will look at additional correctness criteria, such asÂ securityÂ (perform this calculation in a way that keeps part of the answer hidden) andÂ randomisationÂ (implement over-the-internet protocols that depend intrinsically on coin-flipping). Those last two topics will draw on up-to-the-minute research.

Parameterized and Exact Computation,"The course focuses on algorithms for exactly solving NP-hard computational problems. Since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any of these problems, the running time of the algorithms will have a super-polynomial dependence on the input size or some other parameter of the input.
The first part presents algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case, such as branching algorithms, dynamic programming across subsets, inclusion-exclusion, local search, and measure & conquer. We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Whereas the first part presents ""default"" algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f(k)*poly(n) for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization (preprocessing). We will also see problems that are not fixed-parameter tractable and not kernelizable to polynomial kernels subject to complexity-theoretic assumptions.",IT

Engineering Design 2,"This course focuses on the subject of engineering design, which plays the role in guiding an engineer or a team of engineers to think like a designer along a systemic, rational, and creative pathway, towards breakthrough innovations of new product/service. This course provides students with a holistic understanding of the big picture, wide spectrum, and structured process of engineering design. In particular, it focuses on the early stage design, with respect to functional design and conceptual design, which greatly determines the ultimate success of any new product development.
Unlike the purely technical engineering subjects, engineering design is characterized by the synergy between âanalysisâ and âsynthesisâ, between ârationalityâ and âoptimalityâ, as well as between âdo the right thingâ and âdo the thing rightâ. Therefore, this course aims to make you understand the socio-technical nature of engineering design, and provide you with the capacity of not only solving a given design problem using relevant engineering knowledge, but also formulating a new design problem.Â 
Design thinking is a fundamental skill that every engineer must have for the 21st Century. It is one of the skills that profoundly distinguish human intelligence from artificial intelligence, which greatly impacts an engineerâs long-term career success in the workplace. Therefore, this course aims to equip you with the domain-independent and solution-neutral design thinking, which can be applied to whatever technical stream (e.g., aerospace, mechanical, manufacturing, mechatronic, or naval engineering) you choose to pursue in the future.Â 
Finally, todayâs engineering problem is becoming too complex to be addressed by a single engineer based on separate disciplinary knowledge. Therefore, this course also aims to make you understand both opportunities and challenges of collaborative engineering design. Through the pedagogy of project-based learning, itâs expected that your collaborative communication, negotiation, and decision-making skills will be enhanced.",Mechanical

Despite their non-technical nature, the concepts involved in this course are just as challenging as those that are involved in the technical analyses with which most engineering students are more familiar. A professional engineer can expect to find herself or himself working on several memos, reports and presentations at any given time - it is an essential part of performing effectively in industry. Therefore many tasks will be undertaken, some short and relatively simple, with others more complex and nuanced, partly reflecting the timelines and pressures of the working environment and providing an opportunity to work in different teams on different tasks. Analysis of team structures and interpersonal communication also forms part of the course, as aspects of teamwork such as leadership, conflict resolution, managing differing technical skill levels and cultural backgrounds are vital in professional practice and must be appreciated as useful skills for the engineer.  The centrepiece of the course is a group research project on an area pertinent to modern engineering. This, along with guest lectures from industry professionals will be used to provide insight into the working relationships between professional engineers, clients and management in order to prepare students for the workforce.",Mechanical

Crash Analysis and Design,"Our modern day civil infrastructure includes transport networks, telecommunications, power systems, financial infrastructure and emergency services, all of which are growing more and more interconnected. Moreover, the behaviour of the modern infrastructure is not dependent only upon the behaviour of its parts: complex civil systems (such as modern power grids), communication and transport systems, megaprojects, social and eco-systems, generate rich interactions among the individual components with interdependencies across systems. This interdependent behaviour brings about significant new challenges associated with the design and management of complex systems. Cascading power failures, traffic disruptions, epidemic outbreaks, chronic diseases, financial market crashes, and ecosystem collapses are typical manifestations of these challenges, affecting the stability of modern society and civil infrastructure.
