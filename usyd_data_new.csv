Thesis A,"The ability to plan systematically conduct and report on a major project involving both research and design is an important skill for professional engineers. The final year thesis units (Thesis A and Thesis B) aim to provide students with the opportunity to carry out a defined piece of independent research and design that fosters the development of engineering skills. These skills include: the capacity to define a problem; carry out systematic research in exploring how it relates to existing knowledge; identifying the tools needed to address the problem; designing a solution product or prototype; analysing the results obtained; and presenting the outcomes in a report that is clear coherent and logically structured. The thesis is undertaken across two CONSECUTIVE semesters of enrollment if not students will have to enroll in Thesis A again. Taken together the thesis A covers initial research into the background of the problem being considered (formulated as a literature review) development of a detailed proposal incorporating project objectives planning and risk assessment preliminary design modelling and/or experimental work followed by the detailed work in designing a solution performing experiments evaluating outcomes analysing results and writing up and presenting the outcomes. The final grade is based on the work done in both Honours Thesis A and B and will be awarded upon successful completion Thesis B. While recognising that some projects can be interdisciplinary in nature it is the normal expectation that the students would do the project in their chosen area of specialisation. For student who are completing a Major within their BE degree the thesis topic must be within the area of the Major. The theses to be undertaken by students will very often be related to some aspect of a staff member's research interests. Some projects will be experimental in nature others may involve computer-based simulation and analysis feasibility studies or the design construction and testing of equipment. All however will require students to undertake research and design relevant to the topic of their thesis. The direction of thesis work may be determined by the supervisor or be of an original nature but in either case the student is responsible for the execution of the practical work and the general layout and content of the thesis itself. The thesis must be the student's individual work although it may be conducted as a component of a wider group project. Students undertaking research on this basis will need to take care in ensuring the quality of their own research and design work and their individual final thesis submission. The thesis will be judged on the extent and quality of the student's original work and particularly how critical perceptive and constructive he or she has been in assessing his/her work and that of others. Students will also be required to present the results of their thesis to their peers and supervisors as part of a seminar program. Whilst thesis topics will be constrained by the available time and resources the aim is to contribute to the creation of new engineering knowledge techniques and/or solutions. Students should explore topics that arouse intellectual curiosity and represent an appropriate range and diversity of technical and conceptual research and design challenges.

Capstone Project A,The capstone project requires the student to plan and execute a substantial research-based project using their technical and communication skills to design evaluate implement analyse and theorise about developments that contribute to professional practice thus demonstrating the achievement of AQF Level 9. Students are required to carry out a defined piece of independent research in a setting and in a manner that fosters the development of engineering research skills. These skills include the capacity to define a research question showing how it relates to existing knowledge identifying the tools needed to investigate the question carrying out the research in a systematic way analysing the results obtained and presenting the outcomes in a report that is clear coherent and logically structured. Capstone project is undertaken across two semesters of enrolment in two successive Units of Study of 6 credits points each. Capstone Project A covers first steps of thesis research starting with development of research proposal. Project B covers the second of stage writing up and presenting the research results. Students are asked to write a thesis based on a research project which is very often related to some aspect of a staff member's research interests. Some projects will be experimental in nature others may involve computer-based simulation feasibility studies or the design construction and testing of equipment. Direction of thesis work may be determined by the supervisor however the student is expected to make a significant contribution to the direction of the project and the student is responsible for the execution of the practical work and the general layout and content of the thesis itself. The final thesis must be the student's individual work although research is sometimes conducted in the framework of a group project shared with others. Students undertaking research on this basis will need to take care in ensuring the individual quality of their own research work and the final thesis submission. The thesis will be judged on the extent and quality of the student's original work and particularly how critical perceptive and constructive he or she has been in assessing his/her work and that of others. Students will also be required to present the results of their findings to their peers and supervisors as part of a seminar program. A thesis at this level will represent a contribution to professional practice or research however the timeframe available for the thesis also needs to be considered when developing project scopes. Indeed a key aim of the thesis is to specify a research topic that arouses sufficient intellectual curiosity and presents an appropriate range and diversity of technical and conceptual challenges while remaining manageable and allowing achievable outcomes within the time and resources available. It is important that the topic be of sufficient scope and complexity to allow a student to learn their craft and demonstrate their research skills. Equally imperative is that the task not be so demanding as to elude completion. Finally the ability to plan such a project to achieve results within constraints and the identification of promising areas and approaches for future research is a key assessment criterion.,BMET5020,Biomedical

Executing Projects,Even the best idea or prepared project plan can result in project failure because of poor execution. Executing projects is often associated with the use of tools methods and practices used to achieve project success which usually begins with formal sponsor approval or sanction of a project. However this view omits some essential questions with executing projects. For example what is the best procurement approach? What about project strategy and control? What happens when there is disruption in the project environment and how will this impact the project? Many of these answers lie within the domain of executing projects. In this unit of study you will gain an insight into some of the essential mechanisms needed for executing projects for example procurement approaches strategizing sensemaking and power needed to achieve project success whilst gaining an insight into the dynamics of project execution.,PMGT2854,Management
Project Innovation Management,Innovation is widely-recognised as a major driver of economic growth. Yet innovation projects can be difficult to manage: they typically involve a high level of uncertainty and many organisations are unsatisfied with the level of innovation they achieve. In this unit of study we focus on issues in the management of innovation projects at the individual project level organisational level and across networks of organisations. Since a systematic approach can and does improve our effectiveness in managing innovation we begin by exploring several different process models of the stages through which innovation projects are managed. We discuss context and challenges which impact such projects as well as the concepts of creativity and intellectual property management. Using focused case studies we analyse best practice in the structures and processes that organisations can provide to enable innovation as well as to support the search selection implementation dissemination feedback and evaluation stages of their innovative projects. We also examine the impact of networks on innovation (e.g. collaboration networks) national innovation policies and systems and trends towards open innovation.,PMGT5875,Management
